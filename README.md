# odin-recipes
A simple project showcasing basic HTML skills.
This is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) curriculum.

Elements used:
- html boilerplate code
- lists
- links
- images (alt attribute)
- \<strong> and \<em> tags
- html character codes
- headers and paragraphs

I purposefully restricted myself from using html tags and techniques outside those shown so far in the curriculum.
